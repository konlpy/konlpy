KoNLPy (pronounced *"ko en el PIE"*) is a Python package for natural language processing (NLP) of the Korean language.
For installation directions, see :doc:`here <install>`.

For users new to NLP, go to :ref:`start`.
For step-by-step instructions, follow the :ref:`guide`.
For specific descriptions of each module, go see the :ref:`api` documents.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from konlpy.tag import Kkma
    >>> from konlpy.utils import pprint
    >>> kkma = Kkma()
    >>> pprint(kkma.sentences(u'네, 안녕하세요. 반갑습니다.'))
    [네, 안녕하세요..,
     반갑습니다.]
    >>> pprint(kkma.nouns(u'질문이나 건의사항은 깃헙 이슈 트래커에 남겨주세요.'))
    [질문,
     건의,
     건의사항,
     사항,
     깃헙,
     이슈,
     트래커]
    >>> pprint(kkma.pos(u'오류보고는 실행환경, 에러메세지와함께 설명을 최대한상세히!^^'))

Standing on the shoulders of giants
-----------------------------------

Korean, the `13th most widely spoken language in the world <http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/05/116_157214.html>`_, is a beautiful, yet complex language.
Myriad :ref:`engines` were built by numerous researchers, to computationally extract meaningful features from the labyrinthine text.

KoNLPy is not just to create another, but to unify and build upon their shoulders, and see one step further.
It is built particularly in the `Python (programming) language <http://python.org>`_, not only because of the language's simplicity and elegance, but also the powerful string processing modules and applicability to various tasks - including crawling, Web programming, and data analysis.

The three main philosophies of this project are:

- Keep it simple.
- Make it easy. For humans.
- :ref:`"Democracy on the web works." <contribute>`
