What is NLP?
============

NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a set of techniques for analyzing and extracting, and understanding meaningful information text.

We have various NLP applications in our lives. For example:

- Text summarization (ex: `Summly <http://www.summly.com/index.html>`_)
- Dialogue systems (ex: `Apple Siri <https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/>`_)
- Machine translation (ex: `Google Translate <http://translate.google.com>`_)

And obviously information retrieval systems such as Web search engines.
For a better understanding of NLP techniques, consider referring to the so-called "bibles":

- Jurafsky et al., `Speech and Language Processing <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/908048>`_, 2nd Edition, 2008.
- Manning and Schutze, `Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/776349>`_, 1999.

KoNLPy will help you to actually carry out some fundamental NLP tasks with Korean text.
In case you're interested in handling English text, check out `NLTK <http://nltk.org>`_.


What do I need to get started?
==============================

You have some prerequisites to use KoNLPy.

1. Deep interest in natural languages and some familiarity with the Korean language
2. Understanding of basic Python programming [#]_
3. A "good" text editor and terminal (or Python IDE) [#]_
4. A `Python installation <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_
5. `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_, the Python package manager

Got 'em all?
Then let's go.

If you're up to putting in some more time, try `The Hitchhiker's Guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`_ or `Learn Python the hard way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_.
.. [#] Many use `Sublime Text 2 <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`_ for Python programming. Some others use Vim and Terminal. But other than these, there are numerous great `text editors <http://tutorialzine.com/2012/07/battle-of-the-tools-which-is-the-best-code-editor/>`_ and `Python IDEs <http://pedrokroger.net/choosing-best-python-ide/>`_ out there, so take your pick!
